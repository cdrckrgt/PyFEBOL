TODO:

what were we using from FEBOL that is essential to the project?

different types of sensors
a drone with physics incorporated
    an interface for moving the drone with keras
information filters
    kalman, discrete, particle
cost models
    constant, moving

other policies? 
    not really necessary, maybe a random or mean policy since that's easy

somewhat DONE:
a search domain for the target to live in
    needs movement of target
bearing only sensor
drone with movement

DONE:
